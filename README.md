Apks and aias

Find me on MIT App inventor gallery to edit apps yourself https://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/byauthor/4f4f82b9-affd-e71b-d1a0-7b1e988989d4/name and see it. You may then even publish on google play with a mention to me! Many apps like the food app are internationally useful in every house with taylored menu. If you want to collaborate with me and employ me in a startup let me know.

Also students are welcome to come to my home learn in groups of 3 and program on my laptop and test on my phone or do in their home over video (Class 10-12 or engineerig)
